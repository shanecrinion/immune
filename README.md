## RNA-seq Analysis to Investigate Immune Function and Stress Response in an Irish Schizophrenia Case-Control Study

### Overview

Immune factors are known to play a role in SZ, however their mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Blood based transcriptomic studies have valuable potential to investigate their complex interplay. This research, as part of the Immune Response & Social Cognition in Schizophrenia (iRELATE) project seeks to
disentangle the complex genetic architecture of stress and schizophrenia (SZ) by investigating the presence of differentially expressed genes, enrichment for genes associated with disrupted cells, tissues and pathways, constructing new gene networks and their association with clinical and psychiatric phenotypes and examining cell type proportions

I received funding valued at â‚¬30,000 to generate RNA-sequencing data from the iRELATE study, which I used to complete this analysis. RNA-seq was performed for blood-based samples for 50 SZ cases and 50 healthy controls, before and after a stress test. The steps in this RNA-seq analysis workflow outlined in this repository include cloud computing set-up, sample QC, sequence alignment, post-alignment QC, read counting, differential expression analysis (DEA), gene enrichment analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and cellular deconvolution.

DEA identified 2,545 DEGs associated with SZ status and 770 DEGs associated with stress response.
DEGs for SZ indicated immune responses, while DEGs for stress-test response were biologically aligned. Gene network construction identified one network was enriched for positive symptoms of SZ. One constructed module for SZ was found to be significantly enriched for CNS demyelination processes. Cell type proportions reveal a significant enrichment for T-cells CD8 associated with SZ. This study provides evidence for the relationship between immune response and SZ, and identifies biologically relevant genes, pathways and gene networks. This project also demonstrates that blood-based RNA-seq studies can lead to significant findings on the role of immune function in psychiatry and reveal the underpinning of its pathophysiology.

### Project Description

What the application does - This repository documents the analytical workflow I developed to investigate immune dysregulation using blood-based transcriptomic data from the Immune Response and Social Cognition Study (iRELATE). I successfully

dysregulation in schizophrenia (SZ) using transcriptomic data, as presented in Chapter 3 of my PhD thesis. The study examines differential gene expression and immune cell-type composition in SZ patients.
